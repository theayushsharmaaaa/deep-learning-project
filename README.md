# Deep Learning Project: Fraud Detection in DeFi

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a fraud detection system for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms using deep learning techniques. DeFi platforms have revolutionized the financial world with their decentralized, permissionless, and transparent services. However, they are also vulnerable to fraudulent activities such as scams, rug pulls, and malicious exploits. Our system employs advanced deep learning models to identify suspicious activities and flag potential fraud in real-time on DeFi platforms.

The fraud detection system explores various deep learning approaches, including:
- Anomaly detection
- Classification models
- Graph-based techniques

These models analyze user behavior, transaction patterns, and relationships between entities on the platform to detect abnormal patterns or malicious behaviors. The goal is to enhance security and reduce the prevalence of fraud in decentralized financial ecosystems.

## Dataset

We use the Elliptic Data Set, which maps Bitcoin transactions to real-world entities. The dataset includes both licit and illicit transaction data, structured as a graph where:
- Nodes represent individual Bitcoin transactions
- Edges represent relationships between transactions

Key features of the dataset:
- Over 200,000 transactions
- Divided into licit (legitimate) and illicit transactions
- Each node includes features such as transaction timestamps, Bitcoin flow between addresses, and identifying heuristics
- Graph structure allows for both standard deep learning and graph-based approaches

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set/data).

## Installation

(Add installation instructions here, including required libraries and dependencies)

## Usage

(Add usage instructions here, including how to run the models and interpret results)

## Expected Outcome

The project aims to develop a deep learning-based fraud detection system that can effectively classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This model will enhance the ability of DeFi platforms to identify and prevent illicit activities in real time.
